   - a more interesting question is: Why you need to increase the empty space od your hard disk (of your brain)?
   - we need space so that volatile RAM of our brain have high volume. You can think it as a LEGO box. If you create something (finish or not) from your disassembled LEGOs, you have more space in your LEGO box, for new set of LEGOs.

### Topics that I'm 'curious and interested' about (positive encouragement)

- How to start DE

### Steps
1. Find topics that intrigue you (you need to always reading), BUT:
   - make sure it is in your domain's interest
   - can relate to your position
   - jot it down if it is not that important
2. Write it down but 
   - Do not make it complicated. Write anywhere - you will remember what you have written rather than trying to remember where you have written it.
3. Do the laundry. 

Tips: 
    1. If you have no interest on anything, write what you did on daily basis. Just write it down, everyday, with new information. 
    2. Check you seniors, admirers writings, copy from them. Rewrite their perfect/lousy writing but base on your new profound understanding.
