## How to start writing
    - a more interesting question is: Why you need to increase the empty space od your hard disk (of your brain)?
    - we need space so that volatile RAM of our brain have high volume. You can think it as a LEGO box. If you create something (finish or not) from your disassembled LEGOs, you have more space in your LEGO box, for new set of LEGOs. Now, you can create new thing and add more parts with finished assembled LEGO too. So thus with our brain.

### Topics that I'm curious about

- How to start DE
- How to start ML
- How to negotiate things
- Docker
- HackerRank/leetcode/technical assessment

#### Steps
1. Find topics that intrigue you, BUT:
   - make sure it is in your domain's interest
   - can relate to your position
   - jot it down if it is not that important
2. Write it down but 
   - Do not make it complicated. Write anywhere - you will remember what you have written rather than trying to remember where you have written it.
3. Do the laundry.
